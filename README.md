Features of Java
Pattern
Simple
Java is very easy to lrarn as its synatx is very simple
Its Synatx is based on C++ (Easier for people already familiar with it)
No complicated features like pointers, operator overloading etc
Automatic Garbage Collection to remove unreferenced objects and thus programmers are free from memory management responsibities.
OOPs is more secure as it provides datat hiding features.
An additonal layer(class file) is added in javav to achieve platform independence.
Platform Independent
"Write once run anywhere" feature of Java makes it platform independent.It allows a Java program to run on any operating sysytem like Windows,Linux,Kac or Solaris.
Others language like C,C++ etc. are directly compiled into platfrom speciifc machine codes.
An additinal layer(class file) is added in java to achieve platform independence.
Java Complier creates .class file which contains byte code
JVM(Java Virtual Machine) executes bytle code into machine code.
JVM itself is platform dependent. There is a separate JVM available for each operating system.
Different JVM produces different binaru code for different operating system.
Using byte code and different JVMs for different operating systems Java achieves its platfrom independence and makes software development easy to run on different platform.
